        <p>Cinema City is an international film festival that is held annually in Novi Sad. During those seventh days of the Festival, Novi Sad becomes a festival city, with abundant film, music and academic programmes. The programme concept of the Festival intends for three segments – Cinema City Films, PRO and Music, all of which are carried out across a unique location – the new creative quarter comprised of China Town and Limanski Park.

        Cinema City Films is the main part of the festival, screening over 100 indie films every year. This programme is particularly focused on young film authors from the country, the region and the world. Competition selections include National Class, which screens best domestic achievements; Up to 10,000 bucks, which screens low-budget films from all over the globe; and Fresh Danube Films, which presents choice selection of best debut and second films signed by authors from the Danube region. The film programme also includes review selections, which every year honour different domestic and foreign directors and cinemas, Planet Rock selection for screening the best music documentaries, 360° for presenting the latest achievements of international indie production and special screenings.
        PRO selection of the Cinema City festival is intended for film authors and professionals from the country and the region. Its objective is to support education and networking and cooperation between the people who are the present and the future of domestic and regional cinema. This selection combines two parallel directions of film production in Serbia – domestic film production and foreign production service. PRO selection is comprised of Cinema City Campus – an educational programme for young film authors and professionals from Serbia and the region, and Cinema City Industry – a platform for networking between professionals and for raising issues of special significance for domestic cinema.

        Cinema City Music is the part of the festival that organizes fantastic opening and closing parties, concerts and accompanying music events during the festival, which has so far seen some of the most important domestic and foreign DJs and musicians. A special segment of the music programme is PLANET ROCK FESTIVAL, which is a result of cooperation between the Cinema City Association and HNS Creative. Planet Rock is an interdisciplinary festival, which aims to integrate several segments of alternative culture. The vision of this project is to provide original film and music platform in order to generate the framework for positioning Novi Sad as a new, creative entertainment centre that stimulates alternative and progressive authors.
        As of 2010, the Cinema City festival has been independently organized by the Cinema City Association. The organizational structure is presented through the Board of Directors and the Council of the festival, as well as a number of associates and friends who work throughout the year on development and organization of the festival and other projects of cultural significance. This festival is based on the concept of a festival city, which was promoted at Serbia Film Festival in 2007. Exit Association took over the organization of the festival in 2008, and introduced significant changes in the programme concept. During 2008 and 2009, Cinema City developed into an international film festival, which, through its scope, film programme and distinguished guests from around the world, represents an important cultural and film event for Serbia and the region. In 2010, the organization of the Cinema City festival was assumed by the Cinema City Association, which continues to nurture and develop the festival in terms of both concept and infrastructure.During its previous editions, the Cinema City International Film Festival screened over 800 films, welcomed approx. 300,000 film aficionados and more than 2,500 renowned film professionals from all over the world. Cinema City played host to the Board of the European Film Academy and numerous directors, producers, screenwriters, actors, and film professionals such as Guillermo Arriaga, Juliette Lewis, Béla Tarr, Nick Powell, Bruno Chatelin, Laurence Herszberg, Andreas Dresen, and many film stars from Serbia and the region.</p>
